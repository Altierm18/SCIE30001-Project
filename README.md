R Code used to process and analyze the transcriptomic data from GSE28358

The code is all inside the RMarkdown file "R_Code". Each step of the process is enclosed within a chunk. Brief comments about the task of the chunk and segmented comments on important functions were included. Files extracted from PathVisio were saved as txt files in "Pathway Analysis".

To run the chunk press Ctrl + Shift + Enter.
To run individual lines press Ctrl + Enter
To run the entire code press Ctrl + Alt + R (it may take quite a while)
